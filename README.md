# Portfolio 

----------

Web page project from freecodecamp found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage).

This is from a to do list in the _get started_ section of a post found [here](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516). The list is meant to prepare one's self to become a web developer.

The porfolio project is a webpage that contains information about myself and any projects I have worked on.
